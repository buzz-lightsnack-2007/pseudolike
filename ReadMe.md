# Pseudolike
**_Deal with the advanced data structures like how the IB® official pseudocode does._**

The International Baccalaureate® provides a pseudocode offering convenient methods simplifying the use of advanced data structures. This repository aims to simulate that in other higher-level programming languages where it never existed through manipulating built-in properties.

## Features
| Data Structure | JavaScript | Python |
| -----------: | :--------------: | :-------------------------: |
| Queue | ✓ | 🚧  |
| Stack    | ✓ | 🚧 |
| Collections | ✓ | 🚧 |

For documentation, kindly refer to the [IB Pseudocode rules](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IB-Pseudocode-rules.pdf).

## Usage
To get started, you can download this repository, copy the necessary folder for your programming language, and import the class “IPseudoADS” or its contained classes.
